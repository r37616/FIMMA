**Project Description**
This is a Forefront Identity Manager Connector Space Extension that will allow a user to define the C# code they want executed for a flow rule at run time.  The Synchronization Engine will compile the code and run it in a separate app domain when its initiated ([http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/dynamicCode/DynamicCode.htm](http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/dynamicCode/DynamicCode.htm)).   

This project became a natural extension to the work I did for the Last FIM Workflow You Will Ever Need [http://www.apollojack.com/2012/02/last-fim-workflow-you-will-ever-need.html](http://www.apollojack.com/2012/02/last-fim-workflow-you-will-ever-need.html).  This project is still in its infancy and has only been unit tested, but I wanted to get it out to you in case it might help anyone, as well as, get improvements from the community.
